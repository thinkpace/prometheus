# Prometheus

This repository covers my personal [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) instances, [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/), [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) and [snmp_Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter) (which connects to multiple [Synology](https://www.synology.com) devices). It's used to observe parts of my network infrastructure and collect data from my [Sonnen battery](https://sonnen.de) in combination with [thinkpace/sonnen_exporter](https://github.com/thinkpace/sonnen_exporter).

It covers setup, upgrade and backup of this instance. I publish it because it might help anybody to setup a similar solution.

## Drawbacks

There are some drawbacks in this scenario which I would like to point out:

* Retention time of Sonnen prometheus is configured for 1 year. Default Prometheus retention time is 15 days, so there is huge difference. You definitly need to observe storage usage and adapt retention time if necessary.
* There is no encryption or authentication/authorization included, so I suggest to run this only in a protected environment (like your LAN ... hopefully ðŸ˜‰) and don't publish this service to the Internet.
* [Admin API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) is enabled and accessible without authentication/authorization.
* [Management API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/management_api/) is enabled and accessible without authentication/authorization.
* docker-compose.yml is referencing to the latest images available in Docker Registry. In a commercial environment, this is often seen as an anti pattern because it could lead to unintended updates and broken systems. However, in my specific scenario, I want to refer to the latest available image. If something fails unintended, I need to fix it.

## Requirements

* Ansible 2.7 or higher
* Docker runtime environment with docker compose
* Please have a look at [ansible_playbook.yml](ansible/ansible_playbook.yml) and understand what's happening.

Install Prometheus on hosts of group "prometheus":

```
- hosts: prometheus
  become: true
  roles:
    - install-prometheus
```

Install Alertmanager on hosts of group "prometheus":

```
- hosts: prometheus
  become: true
  roles:
    - install-prometheus-alertmanager
```

Install node_exporter on hosts of group "prometheus_node_exporter" (containing the clients you want to observe):

```
- hosts: prometheus_node_exporter
  become: true
  roles:
    - prometheus.prometheus.node_exporter
  vars:
    node_exporter_enabled_collectors: ["systemd", "processes", {"textfile": {"directory": "{{ node_exporter_textfile_dir }}"}}]
```

Install snmp_exporter on hosts of group "prometheus_snmp_exporter" (please note that this is the host running snmp_exporter, not the hosts to observe!):

```
- hosts: prometheus_snmp_exporter
  become: true
  roles:
    - install-snmp_exporter
```

## Setup

First of all, install Prometheus collection from Ansible Galaxy:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install prometheus.prometheus
```

After that, please instantiate Ansible var samples:

```
cd /YOUR/REPO/CHECKOUT/PATH/ansible
cp roles/install-prometheus/vars/main-sample.yml roles/install-prometheus/vars/main.yml
cp roles/install-prometheus/files/alertrules_sonnen-sample.yml roles/install-prometheus/files/alertrules_sonnen.yml
cp roles/install-prometheus/files/alertrules-sample.yml roles/install-prometheus/files/alertrules.yml
cp roles/install-prometheus/files/scrape_configs_sonnen-sample.yml roles/install-prometheus/files/scrape_configs_sonnen.yml
cp roles/install-prometheus/files/scrape_configs-sample.yml roles/install-prometheus/files/scrape_configs.yml
cp roles/install-prometheus-alertmanager/vars/main-sample.yml roles/install-prometheus-alertmanager/vars/main.yml
```

Open following files in your prefered editor and adapt settings. Backup is implemented using rsync.

* `ansible/roles/install-prometheus/vars/main.yml`
* `ansible/roles/install-prometheus-alertmanager/vars/main.yml`

In my setup, Alertmanager is using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) to send notifications.

To execute this Ansible playbook, you can use following command:

```
ansible -i /PATH/TO/INVENTORY /YOUR/REPO/CHECKOUT/PATH/ansible/ansible_playbook.yml
```

### Start

After setup, all containers needs to get started executing

```
docker compose up -d
```

in setup directory (for Prometheus, Alertmanager and snmp_exporter).

### Upgrade

Ansible role is creating a cronjob which updates base images every night.

## Backup

Backup script triggers a snapshot using Prometheus Admin API. A tgz containing this snapshot will be created at configured rsync target (see [main-sample.yml](/ansible/roles/install-prometheus/vars/main-sample.yml) and [backup_prometheus.sh.j2](/ansible/roles/install-prometheus/templates/backup_prometheus.sh.j2)).
